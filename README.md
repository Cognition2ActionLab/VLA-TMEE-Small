## 🔥 Key Features

1. Trajectory-level MEE reshapes action error distributions in VLA models.

2. Enhances the accuracy and robustness of action generation under standard, few-shot, noisy, and imbalanced settings within a characterized range.

3. A plug-and-play training objective with no inference-time overhead.

4. Provides theoretical analysis that characterizes its optimization properties, robustness, and range of applicability.
